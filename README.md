# Pytorch Gradient Consistency Loss
A PyTorch implementation of the gradient consistency loss function, based on:

Penney, G.P., et al.: A comparison of similarity measures for use in 2-D-3-D medical image registration. _IEEE transactions on medical imaging 17(4)_ (1998) 586â€“595 

The gradient consistency loss is an implementation of the gradient correlation (GC), which is defined by the normalized cross correlation (NCC) between the gradients of two images.
